</ol>
<hr>
<p> There was supposed to be the favorite music genres here but I haven't a single clue as to what genres any of the songs I listen to is under, nor do I even know the artists underneath them. Yeah I don't have a favorite music genre nor did I really care enough to check what I listened to, so I can't do this one, sorry. </p>
